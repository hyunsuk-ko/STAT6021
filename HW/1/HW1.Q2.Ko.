```{r}
covid <- read.csv('UScovid.csv')
```

(a) We are interested in the data on June 3 2021. Create a data frame called latest that: • has only rows pertaining to data from June 3 2021, • removes rows pertaining to counties that are “Unknown”, • removes the column date and fips, • is ordered by county and then state alphabetically Use the head() function to display the first 6 rows of the data frame latest


```{r}
new_covid <- covid %>% filter(date == '2021-06-03') %>% filter(county != 'Unknown') %>% select(-date, -fips) %>%
  arrange(county, state)
head(new_covid, 6)
```

(b) Calculate the case fatality rate (number of deaths divided by number of cases, and call it death.rate) for each county. Report the case fatality rate as a percent and round to two decimal places. Add death.rate as a new column to the data frame latest. Display the first 6 rows of the data frame latest

```{r}
new_covid <- new_covid %>% mutate(death.rate = round(100 * deaths / cases,2))
head(new_covid, 6)
```

(c) Display the counties with the 10 largest number of cases. Be sure to also display the number of deaths and case fatality rates in these counties, as well as the state the counties belong to.

```{r}
head(new_covid %>% arrange(desc(cases)), 10)
```

(d) Display the counties with the 10 largest number of deaths. Be sure to also display the number of cases and case fatality rates in these counties, as well as the state the counties belong to.

```{r}
head(new_covid %>% arrange(desc(deaths)),10)
```

(e) Display the counties with the 10 highest case fatality rates. Be sure to also display the number of cases and deaths in these counties, as well as the state the counties belong to. Is there sometime you notice about these counties?

** Counties with lesser cases tend to have high death rates. **

```{r}
head(new_covid %>% arrange(desc(death.rate)),10)
```

(f) Display the counties with the 10 highest case fatality rates among counties with at least 100,000 cases. Be sure to also display the number of cases and deaths in these counties, as well as the state the counties belong to.

```{r}
head(new_covid %>% filter(cases > 100000) %>% arrange(desc(cases)), 10)
```

(g) Display the number of cases, deaths, and case fatality rates for the following counties: i. Albemarle, Virginia ii. Charlottesville city, Virginia

```{r}
new_covid %>% filter(county == "Albemarle" | county == "Charlottesville city")
```
