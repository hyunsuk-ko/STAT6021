```{r}
data <- birthwt %>%
  mutate(cat_race = case_when(
    race == 1 ~ "white",
    race == 2  ~ "black",
    race == 3  ~ "ohters"
  ))


head(data)
```

**Answer:** As the slopes for all races are not parallel, there appears to be an interaction between race and age; the impact of age on the weight of baby differs among mother's race.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x= age, y = bwt, color = cat_race)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
